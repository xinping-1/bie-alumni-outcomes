<h2>Purpose of this Section</h2>
<p>
  This section is designed to help you explore what’s possible with a Bachelor of International Economics.
  By browsing real career outcomes from BIE alum (Classes of 2025–2019),
  we hope to help you dream big about where your degree can take you — 
  both during your studies and after graduation.
</p>

<h2>How to Use This Resource</h2>
  <p>Review the jobs and organizations below with curiosity. Look for patterns, industries, and roles that interest you. Use this page as a starting point for exploration, not a checklist.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Search by job title, organization, or industry</li>
  <li>Filter by graduation year to see trends across cohorts</li>
  <li>Use tags to identify skills, functions, and career areas</li>
  <li>Look for roles that spark interest — then research them further!</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Many positions listed here were held as co-op placements, internships, 
  part-time work during school, and full-time roles after graduation.
</p>

<h2>What Categories Mean</h2>
<p>
  Each role is assigned a primary category based on its main responsibilities.
  Additional tags provide more detail — including the skills involved,
  the work environment, and where it overlaps with other fields.
</p>

<h2>Data Disclaimer</h2>

  <em>
    This data is primarily self-reported and includes information publicly collected through
